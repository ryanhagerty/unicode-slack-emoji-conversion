# Emoji Conversion
## Convert image file names from unicode to Slack short hand.

## Instructions
* Put all the images you want to map inside the `sourceImages` folder.
  * This assumes they're `PNG` files.
* Run `node emoji.js`
* :tada:

## Resources
* I used the images found on [iamcal's emoji-data](https://github.com/iamcal/emoji-data). This is also where the `emoji_pretty.json` file exists.
* This was used for my [Mister Moji - An LED Panel for your Slack emoji reactions](https://github.com/ryanhagerty/mister-moji), but figured it might be useful to someone else.
